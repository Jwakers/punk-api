### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

What I would add:

- Better input validation and submit validation on filter inputs
- Better error handling
- Loading states for compoenents (show a spinner whilst the api fetches the data)
- Overall design (currently basic styles and transitions are used, would like to expand on this with a more dynamic display, for example CTA bloks appearing in sequence, as though they were stacking.)
- More filters and sorting options
- 'No results' component (with search tips)
- Add pagination for larger result sets
- Show all details of beer when CTA is clicked (new page)
