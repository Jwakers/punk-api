### Run locally

`npm start`

### What I would add:

- Better input and submit validation on filter inputs.
- Better error handling (in page messageing, handle status codes etc)
- Loading states for compoenents (show a spinner whilst the api fetches the data for example)
- Overal design (currently basic styles and transitions are used, would like to expand on this with a more dynamic display, for example CTA bloks appearing in sequence, as though they were stacking.)
- More filters and sorting options
- 'No results' component
- Add pagination for larger result sets
- Show all details of beer on a different page when CTA is clicked
- Refine the sort to re-sort data when fetched, if a sort option has already been selected
- Simple tests using Jest
- Fix issue causing chrome browser to offer translation from French to English
